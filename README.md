## [Blattwerk - Betula](https://github.com/Cs4System/Eurorack/tree/main/Betula)


- 8 channels In/Out ADAT Interface
- Outputs are DC coupled
- Inputs can be switched with jumpers between AC and DC coupling (In 2 groups: channel 1-4 and channel 5-8)
- Low noise: -110dB
- Low THD: >0.01% @ 1kHz, -6dB(+-5Vpp)
- 22kOhm input-impedance, 1kOhm output-impedance
- 8HP
- All channels with bicolored indicator LED
- ADAT sync indicator LED
- No Î¼Controller, no programming required, hardware only
- CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 DO NOT USE COMMERCIALY!
- small and dense SMD build (0603,TSSOP)
- 180mA @ +12V and 100mA @ -12V
(Without connected ADTA-signal:
14mA @ +12V and 0mA @ -12V)
